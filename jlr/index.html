                <P><h4>Today’s research is tomorrow’s reality. The world of mobility will see more change in the next ten years than the last century. Autonomous, connected, electric and shared mobility services will transform society. We have already successfully tested our self-driving prototype vehicles on complicated inner-city roads. Our vehicles are more connected than ever, to each other and the infrastructure around it. We have tested smart technology that communicates with traffic lights to calculate the vehicle’s optimal speed to reduce time spent at red lights, improving traffic flow and reducing emissions.

                    The Jaguar I-PACE embodies the innovation that puts us at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. We invest in, trial, test and launch new transport and mobility services from ride-hailing to self-driving.
                    
                    We have partnered with Waymo to bring the first premium self-driving electric vehicle, the Jaguar I-PACE, to the Waymo fleet. We work together with Blackberry, on cybersecurity and machine learning solutions. Our research teams work closely with academic partners at leading global universities innovating together to bring the latest technology developments to our vehicles.
                    
                    We have also formed a multi-year strategic partnership with NVIDIA, the leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and computing, to jointly develop and deliver next-generation automated driving systems plus AI-enabled services and experiences for our customers.
                    
                    Starting in 2025, all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will be built on the NVIDIA DRIVE™ software-defined platform—delivering a wide spectrum of active safety, automated driving and parking systems as well as driver assistance systems. Inside the vehicle, the system will deliver AI features, including driver and occupant monitoring as well as advanced visualisation of the vehicle’s environment. </h4></P>
